  "text" : "Intro to TARDIS Creation\nWhen making your first TARDIS, you have many options. You may opt to create your own TARDIS from scratch, giving you an artificial TARDIS, or you may grow your TARDIS, giving you a natural TARDIS\nThe main difference between an artificial and natural TARDIS is the interior, the interiors of natural TARDISes are filled with organic interior rock, whilst artificial TARDISes are set in an endless void.",
