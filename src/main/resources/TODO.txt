Valkyrian Skies compat!!

IMPLEMENT ENGINES! (Not just the interface)
Fault Locator
Subsystem/Control durability
Navigational Diagnostic Readout (Name pending): Shows exterior location diagnostics such as oxygen, mavity, radiation levels, humidity (if underwater: 100%, if raining, 100%, otherwise use the biome temp), biome temperature, etc.
Add more subsystems
Flight Speed

Temporal Drift (Flying for long periods of time adds "Drift", more drift = landing farther off course) And a way to compensate
Temporal Anchor (Keeps the TARDIS from taking off)
Fix the Portal Block hologram
Brakes (turning off brakes makes the screech sound go away)
Emergency Jump, dumps all power (FE/AU) and insta-travels to a "Safe" spot, either the farthest waypoint, the gallifrey citadel (if unlocked) or spawn at the overworld.

Difficulty Modes
    Casual Mode:
        Very simple travel, auto-flight, no damage or drift, just set coords, take off, land, profit.
    Normal Mode:
        Full controls, but with UI prompts.
    Expert/Manual Mode:
        No help â€” figure out proper lever combos and diagnostics solo. Great for roleplayers and hardcore fans.
