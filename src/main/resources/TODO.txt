Fault Locator

Navigational Diagnostic Readout (Name pending): Shows exterior location diagnostics such as oxygen, mavity, radiation levels, humidity (if underwater: 100%, if raining, 100%, otherwise use the biome temp), biome temperature, etc.

Flight Speed

Temporal Drift (Flying for long periods of time adds "Drift", more drift = landing farther off course) And a way to compensate
Temporal Anchor (Keeps any TARDIS within range from taking off)
Brakes (turning off brakes makes the screech sound go away)
Emergency Jump, dumps all power (FE/AU) and insta-travels to a "Safe" spot, either the farthest waypoint, the gallifrey citadel (if unlocked) or spawn at the overworld.
~~Emergency Program One: https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Emergency_Program_One~~ DONE! TODO: System to change EP1 coords

Difficulty Modes
    Simple Mode: (Blue Boringers)
        Very simple travel, auto-flight, no damage or drift, just set coords, take off, land, profit.
    Normal Mode:
        Full controls, but with UI prompts.
    Expert/Manual Mode:
        No help â€” figure out proper lever combos and diagnostics solo.

Flight Events

Example Flight Procedure:
    Flip Power Switch
    Input Coordinates (or enable Randomizer)
    Enable the Coordinate Lock-In Switch
    Disable Temporal Anchors
    Set Artron Frequency Controller Modifier
    (Optional) Enable APC (don't use if yw a rough flight/break outta tractor beam)
    (Optional) Toggle Stabilizers (not doing this will result in flight events)
    (Optional) Set Flight Termination Protocol (if unset, will default to Polite Terminus)
    Release Engine Brake
    Pull Demat Lever

    Monitor Diagnostic Screens

    TODO: Add flight events

    Once reached destination, you will achieve "Vortex limbo" (TODO: Make original name)
    once in limbo you may safely disable the coordinate lock-in, re-input coordinates, and loop back to doing flight events
    you may also optionally park in the vortex (Drop temporal anchors so you don't drift too far), or land

    Adjust Temporal Vectors in limbo to compensate for temporal drift (optional)
    Engage Landing Brakes (TODO: Better name for this, think flaps on an airplane, smth designed to slow down the TARDIS before full rematerialization to ensure non-15th doctor landing)
    Once flight speed = 0: Pull Materialization Lever / Engine Brake
    Wait for Landing Confirmation
